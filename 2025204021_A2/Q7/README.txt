USAGE:
1. Open bowling_game.html in a modern web browser
2. Wait for Three.js scene to load
3. Use controls to set power, spin, and direction
4. Enable sound effects if desired (üîä button)
5. Try follow camera mode for different perspective (üì∑ button)
6. Bowl the ball and enjoy the physics simulation
7. Watch for pin wobbles and chain reactions
8. Listen for strike/spare celebration sounds
9. Complete all 10 frames to see final score and achievement
10. Click "Play Again" to start a new game

NOTE:
This is an enhanced bowling simulation with realistic physics, sound effects, and
advanced controls. The spin system allows for hook shots, and the camera system
provides multiple viewing angles. Physics are balanced for playability while
maintaining realism. The game emphasizes fun, visual appeal, proper rule
implementation, and immersive audio-visual feedback.

SPIN CONTROL TIPS:
- Start with 0 spin (center) to learn basic mechanics
- Negative spin (-20 to -50): ball curves left (for left-handed hook)
- Positive spin (+20 to +50): ball curves right (for right-handed hook)
- Combine spin with direction for complex shot angles
- Higher power amplifies spin effect
- Master spin control to hit corner pins and get more strikes!
